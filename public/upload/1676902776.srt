1
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:05,979
Mm...

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,049
Mm.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,491
This is nice.

4
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:17,067
Nothing but us...

5
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,011
We haven't done it like this

6
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,748
in, like, a million years, huh?

7
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:26,152
Or, like, maybe 12.

8
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,638
Really?

9
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,290
And you thought
that was a good idea,

10
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:41,951
to bring that up
right in that moment,

11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,520
right there?

12
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,564
I think I hear the girls.

13
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:51,235
No, you don't.

14
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,512
I thought we were done
with this conversation.

15
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,615
No, you were done
with this conversation.

16
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:00,154
Abby, you knew that
I didn't want any more kids.

17
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:01,724
And you knew I did, okay?

18
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,961
And then you went
and made it impossible,

19
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,464
without even consulting me.

20
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,909
But y... you hated
being on the pill.

21
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,171
Yeah, and you hated
using condoms.

22
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:10,407
Oh...

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,581
Okay? But that's not
actually the point.

24
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:14,381
You never listen to me

25
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:15,918
when we have this conversation.

26
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:16,920
Mom!

27
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:17,989
You know what?

28
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,502
I could've just stopped
taking the pill.

29
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,362
I could've stopped
taking the pill

30
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:25,137
and gotten pregnant,
and not told you...

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,507
but I didn't.

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,374
You know why?

33
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:28,678
Because we're married.

34
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,347
Married people actually

35
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,251
have conversations, right?

36
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:33,520
They discuss things!

37
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:36,325
But you, you just went off
and you got a vasectomy

38
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,864
without even telling me,
and now you...

39
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,134
- Mom.
- Hi, girls.

40
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,135
- Uh, Mom...
- Yeah?

41
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,106
I think that
it's really important

42
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:44,418
that we can bring
our phones on the trip.

43
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:47,414
Oh, well, it's a daddy-daughter
camping trip,

44
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:48,884
so I think
it's really unimportant

45
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,287
that you bring your phones.

46
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:51,289
Oh, great.

47
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:52,501
This is going to be a nightmare.

48
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:54,294
But a very special
daddy-daughter nightmare.

49
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:55,765
Um, guys, I can't go.

50
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,605
Jessalyn is having
an almost-back-to-school party.

51
00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,573
It's the first time

52
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:02,044
one of The Populars
invited me to anything.

53
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:03,113
Oh! "The Populars."

54
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:04,181
Uh, be nice.

55
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:05,426
Jessalyn will have to understand

56
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,423
that you already made
plans with your family.

57
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:09,225
What?

58
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,528
Hey, you know what?

59
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,530
You missing the party
actually means

60
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,133
that they are gonna
be missing you.

61
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,603
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,771
Alanna!

63
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:16,874
That's enough.

64
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:17,943
Mom?

65
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,312
Yeah?
Uh, Aunt Josephine's...

66
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:20,681
on the couch again.

67
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,419
Okay.

68
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,736
You went to the Populars'
all the time!

69
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,599
Oh, are you jealous?

70
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,951
Your latte, madame.

71
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:40,287
So good!

72
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,455
JoJo, you have got to stop

73
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,859
breaking into the house
at night.

74
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,164
Aw, you know you can't make
a grand exit during a fight

75
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,734
and then go home to sleep.

76
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,569
Or maybe you don't know,

77
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:48,880
being the perfect
couple and all.

78
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,474
- We're not so perfect.
- Mom?

79
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,276
Yeah?

80
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:52,277
She's getting a photo booth.

81
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:53,581
That is so cool!

82
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,826
That means you'll have
lots of pictures to look at

83
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,819
when you get home.

84
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:56,720
That's so not fair.

85
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:57,723
A beer?

86
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,759
Josephine.

87
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,166
It is the perfect
hangover remedy.

88
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,302
That's good to know.

89
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,838
Gabby, tell her.

90
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:07,709
You can tell her, too.

91
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,011
Come on, Olivia's 16,

92
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,289
She can handle hearing
stuff about...

93
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,316
Listen to me.

94
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,355
I love you,
but our house, our kids,

95
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:16,593
and we'd rather
you not set this example.

96
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,133
Ooh! Wilderness calls!

97
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,970
I got it.

98
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,778
Wild.

99
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,447
Thanks.

100
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:29,452
Everybody in.

101
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,453
Okay, girls...

102
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:31,456
You ready to go?
Everybody in?

103
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,060
Got your seatbelts on?

104
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,464
Love you, too, sweetheart.

105
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:36,700
I'll take care of 'em.

106
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,342
- See you in a couple days.
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,014
You all in?

108
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:44,916
Yep.

109
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,190
'Kay, I love you, guys! Bye!

110
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:49,592
Don't forget to eat.

111
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,205
About Ben's party...

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,811
I just feel like
I really need some "me" time.

113
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:01,148
Mm-mm. No, you're
not bailing on me.

114
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,119
Friend time is "me" time.

115
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:04,723
Dancing time.

116
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:05,625
Fun time.

117
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,962
Gabby doesn't know
how to have fun.

118
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,902
She's fun.

119
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:11,937
She's charming.

120
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:13,005
- Mm.
- Mm-kay.

121
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,143
Great.

122
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:16,288
You remember how to have fun,
don't you?

123
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:19,418
It looks like this.
Dancing... Dancing time.

124
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,525
There she is.
There she is!

125
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:26,199
Wear those shoes!

126
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,069
I'll pick you up in a few hours.

127
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:37,788
I see you.

128
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,437
Wow.

129
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:05,310
Now, that's a look.

130
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:08,382
Oh, I am totally ready to party.

131
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,425
Oh, yay, Trish is here.

132
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,597
I don't get your thing with her.

133
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,800
Well, I mean...
look at her.

134
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,003
She's perfect.

135
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,139
She's got the perfect hair,

136
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,875
and the perfect dress,

137
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,178
I'm sure her perfect kids

138
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:40,848
are off volunteering somewhere,

139
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,817
while her accessory line

140
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,690
is on some perfect-person
magazine cover.

141
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,258
That was Good Morning, America.

142
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,394
Yeah. Exactly.

143
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,398
- Hi!
- Hi!

144
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:51,435
We thought you two had bailed!

145
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:52,606
Oh, my gosh!

146
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,941
You look incredible!

147
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,687
Please, I've got "double-D"
written all over me.

148
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:56,881
"Divorced and desperate."

149
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:58,684
Let's go dominate
the dance floor. Come on!

150
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:01,022
- I'm just gonna get alcohol.
- Yeah, but then...

151
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,225
Okay.

152
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,326
Hi.

153
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,768
Can I get a dirty martini,
please?

154
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,738
Thank you.

155
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,887
Not your scene either?

156
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,728
I was just watching

157
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,165
that masterful escape
you just made.

158
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,106
This right here
is really important.

159
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,108
Every time I read it,

160
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:45,377
I feel compelled to find out

161
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,147
if Brocklehurst is gonna change.

162
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,316
Ugh. Yeah,
I hate that guy.

163
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,554
I know...

164
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,061
You don't know
who Brocklehurst is.

165
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:54,896
I do.

166
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:57,535
Brocklehurst is the headmaster

167
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:58,938
of the Lowood school.

168
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,140
Total son of a bitch.

169
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:01,242
Jane Eyre.

170
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,346
I've read it four times

171
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,283
since my feminist lit
class in college...

172
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,553
Which, I swear, I did not take

173
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:07,555
to pick up women.

174
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:09,959
Oh. I'm sure.

175
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,966
Uh, Matt Shaw.

176
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,702
Gabby Cartwright.

177
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:17,976
So I got peer-pressured
to be here, by my friends.

178
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,879
What's your excuse?

179
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,750
I had a business meeting
with Ben Winter

180
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,386
and then he dragged me
here to his party,

181
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,190
and left me for the dance floor.

182
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:26,503
And now you're part
of this whole

183
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:27,762
"Mommy's Afternoon Out."

184
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,633
You have kids?

185
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,170
Yeah, I have two kids

186
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:33,574
and a husband

187
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,711
and a white-picket fence.

188
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,082
I'm just a total cliche.

189
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,788
Well, you don't have
the Botox and the bling,

190
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:44,194
and you're not grinding with
overly-tanned, pinky-ringed men.

191
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,537
Yeah, no...

192
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,509
this middle-aged mom
does not grind.

193
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,647
Well, I hate to break it to you,

194
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,551
but 30-something
is not middle-aged.

195
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:59,091
Flattery will get you
everywhere,

196
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,193
Mr. Twenty-Something.

197
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,228
33.

198
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,967
Oh! So old.

199
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,606
I'm 42.

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
There. See?
We're not even that far apart.

201
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:09,646
Let's see when you're 42

202
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,884
and you look back
at how much has changed.

203
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,321
Ah, I bet
you haven't changed at all,

204
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,757
because you look great.

205
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,730
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.

206
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,983
And that's my husband.
Perfect timing.

207
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:28,751
Hello?

208
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:29,986
Sorry!

209
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,458
You're breaking
the no-device rule.

210
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,029
What's going on?
Everything okay?

211
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:42,011
Uh, it should be in the big bag.

212
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,212
No.

213
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:44,148
I packed it.

214
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,560
You're gonna
have to look around for it.

215
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,253
It's not just
gonna jump out of the bag.

216
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,168
Okay, you found it?

217
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,404
Great.

218
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,808
Okay. Bye.

219
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,119
Sorry.

220
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,462
Everything okay?

221
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:09,632
Oh, yeah, yeah.

222
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,135
It was just my husband
and the girls,

223
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,638
they're camping

224
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:13,841
in the wilds of Vermont.

225
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,844
And you restore furniture?

226
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,217
What... How do you know that?

227
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,057
I checked out your website
while you were on the phone.

228
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,159
You did not!

229
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:23,960
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,263
No! It's not
even done yet.

231
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:26,709
- It's so embarrassing.
- Your stuff is great.

232
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,637
Oh, stop it.

233
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,541
Thank you.
It's just...

234
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,844
like a hobby.

235
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:32,888
So you're one of those women
that doesn't give a damn

236
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,883
if you break
a nail? Right?

237
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,685
Look.

238
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:37,253
You've got a callous.

239
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:43,165
You're hand-shaming me.

240
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:49,645
Uh, so I didn't get
to stalk you on the Internet.

241
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,583
What is it that you do?

242
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,452
I'm in social media.

243
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:55,156
Of course you are.

244
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,494
Well, when I was in college,

245
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:02,036
seeing each other face-to-face,
that was our social media.

246
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:07,046
I like seeing people
face-to-face.

247
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,396
Damn. I've got a meeting
that I have to go to.

248
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,934
Oh. It's cool.

249
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,302
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,271
No, don't be.

251
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:20,406
- It's fine.
- I have to go.

252
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,543
But, look, I'm developing

253
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:23,446
this new project in Hartford,

254
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,548
5th and Maple.

255
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,351
Do you want to come
and take a look,

256
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:28,422
tomorrow
at, like, 1:00?

257
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:29,959
I think that you would like it.

258
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:32,264
How do you know
what I would like?

259
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,734
Well, you love Jane Eyre...

260
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,370
you make gorgeous things.

261
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:37,708
It's right up your alley.

262
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:41,181
Tell me you'll come.

263
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:43,286
I'll think about it.

264
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:44,288
You're gonna think...

265
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:46,760
and then say "yes,"
and you're gonna come?

266
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,229
I'll think about it.

267
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,164
Okay.

268
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,368
- Please come.
- I'll think about it.

269
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,468
What are we looking at?

270
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,670
Shh.

271
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:12,444
Who was that young man
you were flirting with?

272
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,549
Oh, we weren't flirting.

273
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:15,694
It was more like a book club.

274
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,122
Besides, he's 12,
and I'm very married.

275
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:21,329
Married doesn't
mean "no fun."

276
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,667
I imagine he would be fun.

277
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,837
Well, there will be
no "imagining"

278
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:27,273
with Matt Shaw.

279
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,614
Matt Shaw?

280
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:31,683
Like...

281
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:35,591
the founder
of Four4site.com?

282
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,995
He didn't seem to mention that.

283
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,466
He didn't say anything?

284
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,736
Well, no, he said quite a bit,

285
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,976
he just didn't mention that.

286
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,589
Nobody knows the world
of being a foster kid

287
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:42,692
better than I do.

288
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,629
15 homes in 10 years,

289
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,065
switching schools every time.

290
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,467
I only made it to college

291
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,541
because I lucked out
with the Reardons in 9th grade,

292
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,785
which is why
I'm building schools,

293
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,314
whose mission it is
to give kids consistency,

294
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:55,818
so they feel can safe,

295
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,330
so they can soak up knowledge
without worrying

296
00:12:57,354 --> 00:12:59,124
if tonight they're gonna
have to move on.

297
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,228
Today, I dedicate the first
of what I hope will be

298
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,499
hundreds
of Reardon charter schools.

299
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,271
Good?

300
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,377
I think that's fine, right?

301
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:14,656
Hey.

302
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,926
Hey.

303
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,101
That was cool.

304
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,873
Yeah, you caught me, huh?
Okay.

305
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:27,046
I'm glad you came.

306
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,852
Oh, okay, and this is gonna be
the study center,

307
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,689
where there will always be
access to tutors

308
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,192
in every subject.

309
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,428
Must have been hard for you,

310
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:35,463
to grow up like that.

311
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,770
I'm not gonna say
that it wasn't,

312
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,674
but if I didn't
grow up in the system

313
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:43,814
wanting that connection
with past friends and family,

314
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,351
then I wouldn't have
created Four4site...

315
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,254
and without it,

316
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:50,360
I wouldn't be able
to build this, so...

317
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:52,163
You know, I just...

318
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,871
I want this place
to feel like more than a school,

319
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,842
like a home.

320
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,514
And you have an eye for that.

321
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,520
Would you consider coming on
as a design consultant?

322
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:05,691
Are you serious?

323
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:06,902
Yeah, I've been thinking about

324
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,606
working with repurposing
existing pieces here,

325
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,369
and that's exactly what you do.

326
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:14,474
Sometimes, these things
just fall into place.

327
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,690
Okay, I've to go meet
with some potential donors,

328
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:24,428
which is far less intriguing
than hanging with you,

329
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,664
but think about it.

330
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,372
Claire?

331
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:35,885
Hello?

332
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,087
- Hey.
- Hey!

333
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,991
So much for
the great outdoors, huh?

334
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:40,594
Yeah, my weather app
didn't mention

335
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,662
torrential rain and wind.

336
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:44,034
- Hello.
- Hi.

337
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:47,073
So, before the girls
come down for dinner...

338
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:50,714
we shouldn't be
talking about it yet...

339
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:53,385
But...
she can't keep a secret.

340
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,555
You're pregnant!

341
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,058
Oh, my God!

342
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,460
We just found out.

343
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,801
Oh, that's so awesome.

344
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,370
I'm so happy for you.

345
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:03,873
We're not
telling the little ones.

346
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,109
I'm starving.

347
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:07,748
All right, who wants a hamburger

348
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,750
and who wants a hot dog?

349
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:09,652
I want a hamburger.

350
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:12,123
Hamburger, hot dog...

351
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,162
A hot dog and a hot dog.

352
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,933
I think we've got enough.

353
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:17,935
A hot dog...

354
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:20,607
nothing for you.

355
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,443
Okay...

356
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,103
Is it that they're pregnant?

357
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,007
Don't. Don't. Don't.

358
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,478
Gabby, if I would have known
how strongly you felt...

359
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:58,081
You did know.

360
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,764
Gabby, look, I thought
it was the fair thing to do,

361
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,867
and I still do.

362
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,736
You thought it was
the "fair" thing to do?

363
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,306
How is any of this fair for me?

364
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:11,385
I thought you'd be all right.

365
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,412
I thought that
you would get over it.

366
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:17,120
Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm really
trying to get over it,

367
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:18,723
but every time we have sex,

368
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,362
all I keep thinking
about is, like,

369
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,967
"How... how could he not
talk to me about this?"

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,305
I mean, seriously, who are you

371
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:29,277
that you would go make
this decision on your own?

372
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,716
What... What is it

373
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:32,517
about our marriage

374
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:36,391
that you would
choose to do that?

375
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,598
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,374
Then reverse it.

377
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:47,815
Re... W-What?

378
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:49,652
I mean, if you're sorry,

379
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,323
then reverse the vasectomy.

380
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,168
No?

381
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:02,376
So you're sorry...

382
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,316
you're just not sorry enough.

383
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,819
Gabby, just... Gabby, don't.

384
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,032
Okay!

385
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,302
Got everything?

386
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,370
Yep!

387
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,883
Okay, Olivia, here's
your ham-and-cheese sandwich.

388
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,209
I'm a vegan.

389
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:37,981
Okay. You know what?
Just eat the bread.

390
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,520
Okay! Make good choices.
Be smart.

391
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,323

Hi. Oh, my God!
Look at you!

414
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:16,933
I know, instant baby bump.

415
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,204
Wow! You look
beautiful.

416
00:20:19,237 --> 00:20:20,707
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

417
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:21,509
How was, uh, how was

418
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:22,920
New Year's in Vermont?
How's Elliot?

419
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:24,047
It was good, it was good.

420
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,048
We're good.

421
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:27,020
How, um, how's
Mr. Four4website guy?

422
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,155
Oh...

423
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,225
I mean, what we're doing
with these schools

424
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,196
is so amazing.

425
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:33,900
What?

426
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,269
Eh. You just...

427
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:37,975
you light up
when you talk about that guy.

428
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,778
- Claire.
- Okay. I'm fine.

429
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:41,381
- Stop.
- There she is!

430
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:44,521
Daughter number two,
off to the orthodontist.

431
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:45,924
So you're gonna be
even prettier?

432
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,262
That's impossible!

433
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:05,697
Mom?

434
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,034
Mom, can we please go already?

435
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,005
Yes. We can go.

436
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,152
It feels really good

437
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:41,822
to be able to help, you know?

438
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:44,628
To be a part of
something special

439
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:46,398
and, plus, it's grown-up dinner

440
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,001
and it's really good
for my career.

441
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,709
No making faces.
You look amazing.

442
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:52,677
Okay.

443
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:55,784
Claire shamed me into
buying some new clothes,

444
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:56,653
good clothes.

445
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:58,222
My pants were falling off.

446
00:22:58,255 --> 00:22:59,399
I haven't been hungry lately.

447
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:00,660
Not hungry?
What's that?

448
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:02,697
Love you.

449
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:08,375
When they told me

450
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:10,078
that they wouldn't
sell me the company,

451
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:13,051
I just made them an offer
that they couldn't refuse.

452
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,929
So where... where is everybody?

453
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:21,200
Everybody who?

454
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,573
The everybody... the architects,

455
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:25,510
that we're supposed
to be meeting.

456
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:29,017
Uh, there...
was some rescheduling.

457
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:33,793
But I thought that you
and I could still...

458
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:36,030
get together.

459
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:42,877
Okay, I mean...

460
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:44,314
it's one thing

461
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:47,286
to be a little flirty
over text, but...

462
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,594
to be together
and for you to be flirty

463
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,864
with someone
that you can't have...

464
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,002
Are you absolutely certain

465
00:23:55,036 --> 00:23:57,407
that I'm flirting
with somebody that I can't have?

466
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,778
This is not a game for me.

467
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,285
This is real life, you know?
Like, I...

468
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,755
I have a husband.

469
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,061
I can't do this.

470
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:11,101
Okay.

471
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,469
So...

472
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:17,413
Co-workers, and...

473
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:19,818
if you're really lucky, friends.

474
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,054
Friends.

475
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:22,357
Okay.

476
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,006
Hi!

477
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,340
You're up?

478
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,244
Yeah. I don't have
the best news.

479
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:34,514
I have to, uh,

480
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:36,986
cover for Dipka at
a medical conference in Santa Fe

481
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:37,788
next week.

482
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,190
Next week is Spring Break.

483
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:41,127
Your sister has the girls.

484
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:41,996
We made that reservation

485
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:44,367
at that cute, little
hotel in Montauk.

486
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,004
Yeah, can we change that?

487
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:49,277
To another Spring Break
when the kids are away?

488
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,580
Uh...

489
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,258
The hotel has a spa.
Why don't you just come with me?

490
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:56,257
Uh, okay, but the idea wasn't
for me to spa by myself

491
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,994
while you talk
G.I. issues, right?

492
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:58,797
The whole idea

493
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,900
was for us to be together,

494
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,470
to reconnect.

495
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:05,743
Mm. I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

496
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:14,801
"Private food"

497
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:16,939
is that, like, gross-combo food

498
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:19,979
that you only eat when
you're at home alone.

499
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:20,847
Hmm.

500
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,750
So, like, mayonnaise
and Graham crackers.

501
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:24,020
- Ugh! Okay. Well...
- Yeah.

502
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:26,626
Well, I'm gonna do
leftover pasta

503
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,697
with some eggs
and hot sauce and cheese

504
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,199
as soon as I get home,

505
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,869
and think of you.

506
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,507
This is my workshop.

507
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,873
Gabby...

508
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:54,681
Your work is amazing.

509
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:58,690
It's just a...
a glorified hobby.

510
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:01,260
Why don't you shut up
and take the compliment?

511
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,402
I'm really bad at that.

512
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,479
Those chairs aren't done yet.

513
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:11,849
They're gonna be super-cool

514
00:28:11,882 --> 00:28:13,852
when they are, though.

515
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,776
This is it.

516
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,786
This is the desk
you made for me.

517
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,103
It's perfect.

518
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:08,428
Matt...

519
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:12,604
Matt, I...

520
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:14,975
Look at me.

Uh... Matt?

527
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:41,147
I have to pick Elliot
up from the airport.

528
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,418
Please...

529
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,690
please leave, okay?

530
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:48,094
Gabby...

531
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:54,240
We were in the hot tub,

532
00:30:54,273 --> 00:30:56,745
in the middle of a deep debate
about Crohn's disease,

533
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:58,248
and it did occur to me

534
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:00,754
that you not coming with me
was probably the right move.

535
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah. Maybe I should have.

536
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:05,495
You okay?
You don't look so good.

537
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,801
No, it's fine, it's just
I have a turpentine headache.

538
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,169
I'm gonna take a nap.

539
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,173
Yeah.

540
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:04,413
This is a library, right?

541
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:06,518
So we've got to have
a higher ceiling, I think.

542
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:08,990
Ah, there you are,

543
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:11,695
and I've got
the architects this time.

544
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,364
I'm not staying.

545
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:19,076
Okay... can you just
give us five minutes?

546
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:25,155
Okay, don't...

547
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:27,693
Just... stay there.

548
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:29,831
Was I that bad?

549
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,267
No. You were that wrong.

550
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,304
I've never heard
that one before.

551
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:36,076
Look.

552
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,683
I forgot that marriage is-is...

553
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:40,118
is fragile and...

554
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:44,861
you can't do what we did,
and still expect it to work.

555
00:32:44,894 --> 00:32:45,930
I really do like you.

556
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,801
Y-You can't.

557
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,573
Okay? You can't like me.

558
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,492
So...

559
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,395
friends?

560
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:12,215
Gabby.

561
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,457
It was just one night.

562
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:19,864
Everything's gonna be all right.

563
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:35,495
♪ The sea will rise
The ship will come ♪

564
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:45,048
♪ The sea will rise
The ships will come ♪

565
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,321
♪ And sail us
Through the night ♪

566
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:52,797
♪ So leave with me now

567
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:56,671
♪ Don't leave it
Till morning comes ♪

568
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,780
♪ We've nowhere to hide

569
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:04,120
♪ But there's a million

570
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:06,558
♪ A million miles to run

571
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,955
A piercing party for 'tweens?

572
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,958
It's just ears.

573
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,193
Oh, that sounds like fun, huh?

574
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:26,565
No. It-It doesn't
sound like fun.

575
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,432
Look, you can go,

576
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:28,936
but you can't get
anything pierced.

577
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,840
I had to wait until I was 13

578
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:31,918
and brought home
an "A" in math, so...

579
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:33,411
Shut up, that was centuries ago.

580
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:34,379
It was, like, three years ago!

581
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:35,592
I can't go and not get pierced.

582
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,383
Well, then don't go!

583
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,428
But the Populars will think...

584
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,589
I... You know what?

585
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,693
I don't care
what "the Populars" will think.

586
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,264
Okay? And you shouldn't care
what the Populars will think.

587
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,769
You should care
what you will think!

588
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,524
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,764
I'm sorry.

590
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:13,592
Oh, God.

591
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:22,342
Come in.

592
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,480
Okay, so, the reason

593
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:27,854
I've been a raving
bitch lately is...?

594
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,289
Well, it's not menopause.

595
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:30,893
You're pregnant.

596
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:39,811
Are you sure it's not menopause?

597
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:40,846
Positive.

598
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,854
It would really be better
if it was menopause.

599
00:35:45,923 --> 00:35:48,027
Can... Can you check again?

600
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:50,132
Will... Will you just
check again for me?

601
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:53,237
I checked again.
Pregnant. Congratulations.

602
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:57,045
I mean, that's... that's amazing.

603
00:35:57,078 --> 00:35:59,851
That's great news.
Right? I mean, right?

604
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,456
So, like, I don't know,
I'm just curious,

605
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:05,061
off the top of your head,

606
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,967
do you have any idea
what the chances are

607
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,072
that I get pregnant
if, let's say,

608
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:12,475
my husband had a vasectomy?

609
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:14,814
And I'm... I'm...

610
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:20,592
I'm asking for a friend
who this happened to recently.

611
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,668
0.05%, maybe?

612
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:26,771
That much, huh?

613
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:29,877
She's gonna be
bummed about that.

614
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,317
She's gonna be really bummed.

615
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,531
Mom? Mom, can you make
some melted butter?

616
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:30,766
You know, you're gonna
have to make it yourself

617
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,769
if you want it.

618
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:34,774
I have to go out back
and work on something.

619
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:38,481
Here, have some.

620
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:50,573
Damn, damn, damn.

621
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:52,610
Damn.

622
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:01,695
Oh...

623
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,399
Such a disaster.
What am I gonna do?

624
00:38:07,006 --> 00:38:09,009
Don't have the baby.

625
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,382
Try to save your marriage.

626
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:16,023
Don't have the baby?

627
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,764
Elliot'll never know.

628
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:22,803
Just do it and... and...

629
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,509
try to go back
to your normal life.

630
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:31,688
I feel like I've wanted
this baby for so long...

631
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:34,995
It's like the biggest blessing

632
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:38,735
and the worst thing
that could possibly ever happen.

633
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,277
And Claire...

634
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,849
you know I could
never have an abortion.

635
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:09,664
Elliot.

636
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,802
El.

637
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:13,838
What?

638
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:17,045
Gabby, what is it?

639
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,201
I'm not stupid, Gabby.

640
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:29,402
I'm not saying you're stupid,

641
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,207
but there is a possibility,

642
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,311
a 0.05% chance that...

643
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:34,313
Don't.

644
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:35,682
You know that's not what I mean.

645
00:39:35,716 --> 00:39:37,152
But-But there is a possibility.

646
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:38,120
Is that really what you believe?

647
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:39,691
Okay. All right.

648
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:41,695
You look at me
and tell me honestly

649
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,266
that you think that we won

650
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,237
some bizarre lottery here.

651
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,272
Elliot, I... I...

652
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:48,340
If you're honest with me,

653
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:50,178
I can deal with anything,
all right?

654
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:51,581
But what I can't deal with

655
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:53,284
is lies from you.

656
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:54,587
Look at me!

657
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,536
I don't know how to...
I don't know how to tell you.

658
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,105
Tell me what?

659
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:08,982
I only had sex with him once.

660
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:13,759
- No, stop.
- It was just...

661
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:17,131
You know, you only had sex
with who once?

662
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:21,507
Matt Shaw.

663
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,110
Jesus Christ.

664
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,580
Elliot.

665
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:25,582
- I'm telling you and...
- You did that?

666
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:26,627
- I love you.
- You slept with...

667
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:27,887
It didn't mean anything.

668
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,058
You're pregnant
with someone's baby

669
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:31,160
who you slept with?

670
00:40:31,193 --> 00:40:32,405
- I don't want to lose you...
- I thought you went to...

671
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,641
Don't want to lose this baby.

672
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,311
- A sperm bank or something!
- You hear me?

673
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:36,303
Listen to me!

674
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:37,414
What do you expect me to say?

675
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:38,708
I don't know!
I-I-I...

676
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:39,787
I thought maybe
we could figure out

677
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:41,213
a way to work
through this together.

678
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:43,017
Work through this?

679
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:46,357
Elliot, please.
Just try to...

680
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,729
try to look at this
through my eyes.

681
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:49,864
Just-Just for a second.

682
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,001
We are such an amazing family,

683
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:52,937
the four of us,

684
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,676
and this would just be
someone else to love.

685
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:57,780
Someone... Someone who
would love you back,

686
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,216
that wouldn't have to know...

687
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,586
I would know!

688
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:01,754
All right? I would know!

689
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:03,424
You're asking me to raise a kid

690
00:41:03,457 --> 00:41:04,627
who-who isn't mine?

691
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:07,933
Who we'd be lying to
for their whole life?

692
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,448
Elliot? Elliot, please!

693
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:16,517
Listen to me!

694
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:18,053
Elliot. Elliot,
wait a minute.

695
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:19,189
Where are you going?

696
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:21,060
Elliot!

697
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:22,730
Where are you going?

698
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,499
Mom, what's going on?

699
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:28,875
It's okay. Everything's okay.
Just go back to bed.

700
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,579
Go back to bed.

701
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,516
Where's Dad going?

702
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,419
No...

703
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:37,425
Elliot!

704
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,990
Hey. This is Elliot.
Leave a message.

705
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:12,930
Uh, El... Elliot, it's me again.

706
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:17,004
Uh, can you... can you please
just call me back?

707
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,675
Or text me back?

708
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,912
I just... I just want to know
that you're okay.

709
00:42:37,412 --> 00:42:39,282
Mom...

710
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:43,157
Mom! Why'd you
sleep on the couch?

711
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,127
Oh...

712
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:46,931
Look, where's Dad?

713
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,612
He promised to make
omelettes this morning.

714
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:50,405
Uh, he's... he's...

715
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:53,143
one of his patients
had an emergency.

716
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:06,170
Elliot...

717
00:43:06,203 --> 00:43:07,640
we have to talk.

718
00:43:07,673 --> 00:43:08,975
No, Gabby, I can't.

719
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:10,988
Where am I supposed to tell
the girls that you are?

720
00:43:11,012 --> 00:43:12,182
At work.
Just leave me alone.

721
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,184
There has to be

722
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:15,556
some way that I can make
this right to you, okay?

723
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:18,093
Please. I am not
in love with Matt Shaw.

724
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:20,131
Just things were... were so off.

725
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,066
Oh, that justifies it?

726
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,546
No, it doesn't justify it!
Of course not.

727
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,843
Whatever was going on with us
is what was going on with us,

728
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:27,613
but you slept with another man.

729
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,986
And you had a vasectomy
behind my back...

730
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:33,024
How am I supposed get over this?

731
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:34,861
Every day, there'll be
this kid in our lives

732
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:36,765
who will be a reminder
of what you've done.

733
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:38,367
So, I mean, are you saying

734
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,675
that if I don't have the baby,
that you'd come back?

735
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,812
Because I-I can't,
that would break me.

736
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:45,916
No, I would never ask you
to do that.

737
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:47,853
But I don't want another child.

738
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:50,992
How could you do this?

739
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,636
I don't know.

740
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:57,807
I just...

741
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,346
Honestly, I just
wasn't feeling good about us,

742
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:03,217
or about me,

743
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:05,756
and the girls
are growing up so fast,

744
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:07,459
and then it-it happened,

745
00:44:07,492 --> 00:44:09,229
and I realized
it was all bullshit.

746
00:44:09,262 --> 00:44:10,064
Really?

747
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:13,136
Because now it's a new life.

748
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,335
Hey.

749
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:47,439
Hi.

750
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:48,842
You okay?

751
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:52,014
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

752
00:44:53,384 --> 00:44:55,354
Yeah, I'm fine.

753
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,358
Oh.

754
00:44:57,391 --> 00:44:59,128
Oh... Oh...

755
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:01,500
Are you sick?

756
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:02,803
No.

757
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:05,341
I'm not sick.

758
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,349
What's going on?

759
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:16,630
Mom?

760
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:18,367
Okay, no. You know what?

761
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,906
You need to lay off
the whole you're "the grown-up"

762
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:22,150
and "we're the kid"
part already,

763
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:23,353
because walking out on Mom
when she's pregnant,

764
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:25,481
that's not
a very grown-up thing to do!

765
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:26,560
I get that you feel that way.

766
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:27,695
No. Don't you talk down to me.

767
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:29,022
You're still my child!

768
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:30,568
Yeah! And you know what?
This is about your new child!

769
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:32,495
It's not his fault!

770
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:38,841
It's not his.

771
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:41,548
What?

772
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:44,419
It's... It's...

773
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,189
It's not... his.

774
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:48,260
Mom.

775
00:45:52,435 --> 00:45:54,940
It's not your dad's baby.

776
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:59,817
Gabby, I wasn't
going to tell them.

777
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:01,587
No, I know,
but they have to know the truth.

778
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:04,125
They can't blame you forever.

779
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,262
It's not your baby?

780
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,090
Olivia...

781
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:22,930
Olivia, listen to me.

782
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:25,802
Please.
Olivia.

783
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:29,242
Olivia.

784
00:46:30,043 --> 00:46:31,815
How do you
just sleep with somebody

785
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:33,083
when Dad is so great?

786
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:34,686
Who is it?

787
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,765
You don't know him.
It doesn't...

788
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:36,800
It doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

789
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:38,103
Oh, so you just
slept with somebody

790
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:39,563
who doesn't matter to you?

791
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:40,608
That means
we don't matter to you?

792
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,601
Is that what that means?

793
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:42,803
Of course not, Olivia!

794
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:44,272
- Dad!
- No, don't, Olivia.

795
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:46,410
- Dad!
- Listen to me, right now!

796
00:46:46,443 --> 00:46:47,278
- Dad.
- Olivia!

797
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:48,147
- Dad.
- Olivia.

798
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,282
Can I please come with you?

799
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:50,285
O-Okay.

800
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:52,188
Maybe, for now, maybe
that's the best idea.

801
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:52,957
Elliot.

802
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,760
- Listen to me.
- Okay, go.

803
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:56,096
Olivia!

804
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,900
Mom! Mom?
Do I have to go, too?

805
00:46:57,934 --> 00:47:00,872
No. No, you don't.

806
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,486
He's here.
I have to talk to him.

807
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,266
I know he's here,
because his car's out front,

808
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,126
so please, please,
we have to talk...

809
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,697
Okay, yeah, yeah, I get...
I know.

810
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,001
Yeah, he's still here...

811
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:36,009
He doesn't want to talk to you.

812
00:47:37,478 --> 00:47:39,650
I'm sorry.

813
00:47:39,683 --> 00:47:41,453
I think he just
needs some space.

814
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:45,027
Maybe if you give him
a little more time...

815
00:47:45,061 --> 00:47:48,333
he can learn to understand.

816
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,545
I'm sorry, I don't know...

817
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:55,013
I love you.
I don't...

818
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:56,784
Let me... Let me drive you home.

819
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:57,986
Let me...

820
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,590
It's okay, Claire.

821
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:09,610
♪ A shadow
That just never stops ♪

822
00:48:13,316 --> 00:48:19,061
♪ Look at how much
It's cost ♪

823
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:23,103

824
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:26,376
♪ Are the void

825
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:31,186
I was told tequila
was inappropriate right now.

826
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:34,760
I mean, at least

827
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:36,196
Olivia's talking to you.

828
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:37,967
She's not even talking to me.

829
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,069
16-year-olds

830
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:40,906
aren't supposed
to talk to their moms.

831
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:42,408
I still don't talk to Mom.

832
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:44,781
I'm such an idiot.

833
00:48:44,814 --> 00:48:47,853
You're not an idiot, Gabby.

834
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,291
You're human,
and humans screw up.

835
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:52,161
You just didn't know that before

836
00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:54,432
because you never did.

837
00:48:59,442 --> 00:49:02,481
All you can do is move on
the best that you can.

838
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:11,032
What does baby-daddy Matt
have to say about all this?

839
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:17,444
Gabby!

840
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:19,884
What a happy surprise
to see you on my calendar.

841
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:22,221
It's really good to see you.

842
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:24,726
Come on, I've got something
I want you to see.

843
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,895
I can't believe

844
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,265
it's coming together so well.

845
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,736
Those kids
are so lucky to have you.

846
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,375
I'm just lucky I can help them.

847
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:34,079
So, uh, I mean,

848
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:36,216
do you want
your own kids someday?

849
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,986
You seem to love them so much.

850
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,455
Uh, no.

851
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:42,462
No.

852
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:45,001
I know firsthand
what it's like to have parents

853
00:49:45,034 --> 00:49:46,904
who aren't ready
to take care of you,

854
00:49:46,937 --> 00:49:49,308
and I could never inflict that
on anyone.

855
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:52,683
That makes sense.

856
00:49:52,716 --> 00:49:55,287
So, tell me why you're here.

857
00:49:57,024 --> 00:50:00,531
I just...
I think you'll make a great dad.

858
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,671
You're sweet...

859
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:06,109
but not in the cards for me.

860
00:50:22,843 --> 00:50:24,012
Mom?

861
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:27,218
Dad got me the dress I wanted
for poetry day.

862
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:30,124
Oh, you mean the one
I said you couldn't have?

863
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:31,795
- Yeah.
- Great.

864
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,098
Excuse me!

865
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,922
Hi. "My name is Alanna.

866
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:47,793
"I like llamas
and I like Michelle Obama.

867
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:50,297
"I have a mother and a father,
and I'm the best daughter.

868
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:52,435
"But don't tell Olivia,
my older sister,

869
00:50:52,468 --> 00:50:54,840
"because, trust me,
she'll be bothered.

870
00:50:54,874 --> 00:50:56,109
"Bye. I'm Alanna.

871
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:58,080
And again,
I like llamas."

872
00:51:25,702 --> 00:51:28,941
Um, so, I-I stopped
by the realtor's office,

873
00:51:28,974 --> 00:51:30,244
and they're gonna have someone

874
00:51:30,277 --> 00:51:33,751
call and make an appointment
to-to value the house.

875
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:36,089
Wait.

876
00:51:36,123 --> 00:51:38,427
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

877
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,032
Why would we sell the house?

878
00:51:41,066 --> 00:51:42,545
Well, we're not
living together anymore.

879
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:44,039
We need money
for separate houses,

880
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:48,113
and, uh, and selling the house
is the easiest way to get it.

881
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:52,054
Yeah, I don't want
another house. Okay?

882
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:54,359
I want our house,

883
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:56,129
and if we're able
to work through this...

884
00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:58,166
There's nothing to work through.

885
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,774
So what are you saying?

886
00:52:04,012 --> 00:52:05,381
Do you want to divorce me?

887
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,253
You haven't left me
any other choice.

888
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,963
Hi.

889
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,231
Hey!

890
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:48,601
I've been texting and calling.

891
00:52:48,634 --> 00:52:51,573
I wanted to come by
and see the baby.

892
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:53,645
How are you?

893
00:52:53,678 --> 00:52:54,680
Flabby.

894
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,149
Emotional. Tired.

895
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:58,554
You don't look
any of those things.

896
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:00,625
How's Elliot?

897
00:53:01,861 --> 00:53:02,996
Don't.

898
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:06,871
Ah. Well, we had coffee
the other day

899
00:53:06,904 --> 00:53:09,643
and he told me he wanted
to sell the house and...

900
00:53:09,677 --> 00:53:11,781
Gabby, what do you
want me to say?

901
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:12,983
Say that it's fine?

902
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:14,486
He's fine? I'm fine?

903
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,355
Olivia, she's doing great?

904
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:17,358
You know, it's super-easy

905
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:18,561
having an extra two

906
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:20,464
lost people living in my home

907
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:22,301
while my third child has colic.

908
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:24,573
I'm sorry, Gabby,

909
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:26,442
but I just... I can't be there

910
00:53:26,476 --> 00:53:29,082
for my family,
and Elliot, and Olivia,

911
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:30,952
and you right now.

912
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:32,655
I get it.
I get it.

913
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:35,194
Come on in, everybody.

914
00:53:35,228 --> 00:53:36,764
Come in and set up.

915
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:39,168
Extra mats are on the wall...

916
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:40,738
Gabby...

917
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,751
Alanna!
Alanna, no, stop!

918
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:06,255
Alanna.
Alanna...

919
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:08,693
Hi!

920
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,565
Ow!

921
00:54:10,598 --> 00:54:11,365
Alanna!

922
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:12,368
Everything's changing.
I hate it!

923
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:14,105
I know, honey.
Me too, honey.

924
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:15,942
You don't get to hate it!

925
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,349
Hi.

926
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:38,788
You know what
I was thinking about?

927
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:40,390
Remember when
we used to go to lunch,

928
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:42,227
and then we'd go to a matinee?

929
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:45,033
Uh, yeah. Um, I have
an AP Chem test right now,

930
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:46,579
and that sounds a lot
more interesting than this.

931
00:54:46,603 --> 00:54:47,573
Okay, can you slow down?

932
00:54:47,606 --> 00:54:48,575
Because I'm really pregnant

933
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,645
and I can't move that fast.

934
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:53,551
You're gonna stay
at our house tonight.

935
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,020
Okay? With me
and Alanna.

936
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:56,824
Uh, no, I'm not.

937
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:59,395
Olivia, you don't
just get to stay

938
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,632
where you want to stay,

939
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:02,143
because you're unhappy
with some of the things

940
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:03,036
that we're...

941
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:04,339
Oh, "some of the things"?

942
00:55:04,372 --> 00:55:05,842
Some of the things?

943
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:08,113
Okay...

944
00:55:08,146 --> 00:55:10,117
most of the things.

945
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,954
Why are you calling it
"our" house,

946
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:14,560
when it's not gonna be that
anymore, because of you?

947
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:17,431
Okay, I know, I suck.

948
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:19,401
But Olivia...

949
00:55:19,435 --> 00:55:21,272
I'm your mother,

950
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:23,811
and I love you so much.

951
00:55:23,844 --> 00:55:25,848
I hate you.

952
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,100
Okay. Hi, Gabby.

953
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:45,107
That's right.
You call us whenever.

954
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,745
Yeah. That's right.

955
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,154
You forgot to revoke my wifely

956
00:56:52,188 --> 00:56:54,225
walk-by-the-receptionist
privileges.

957
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:55,494
It's on the to-do list.

958
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:56,830
Okay, about the house.

959
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:58,476
Well, I'm not planning on
coming back there anymore.

960
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,272
It's our house,
mine and the girls,

961
00:57:01,306 --> 00:57:03,176
and I want to keep at for them,

962
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,713
for their stability.

963
00:57:04,747 --> 00:57:05,815
So I want to buy you out.

964
00:57:05,848 --> 00:57:08,922
It might take me a while, but...

965
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:10,333
I promise you,
you'll get your fair share.

966
00:57:10,357 --> 00:57:11,492
You're neglecting

967
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:13,831
the fact that you need money
to buy me out.

968
00:57:13,865 --> 00:57:16,168
Yeah, I know that.
I'm working on it.

969
00:57:17,337 --> 00:57:19,342
Oh. Him.

970
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:20,211
Right.

971
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:21,680
"Him"? What do you...

972
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:24,218
What do you mean, "him"?

973
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:25,655
Him? No.

974
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:27,859
No, Elliot. Not him.

975
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:29,729
I have nothing to do with him.

976
00:57:29,763 --> 00:57:30,532
It's me.

977
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:33,537
I'm keeping the house.

978
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:40,919
So you really think that we can

979
00:57:40,952 --> 00:57:44,626
turn this yard-sale obsession
into something profitable?

980
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:45,628
I think, to start,

981
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:48,032
we do a furniture pop-up sale.

982
00:57:48,066 --> 00:57:49,769
I'm almost done
rebuilding your website,

983
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,540
and I've a few stores
to still call.

984
00:57:51,574 --> 00:57:53,409
I don't know...

985
00:57:53,443 --> 00:57:55,447
You need money for the house,

986
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:03,129
It's Elliot.

987
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:04,699
Elliot?

988
00:58:05,935 --> 00:58:08,106
What?

989
00:58:12,715 --> 00:58:14,317
You held down Josh Gordon

990
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:15,688
and cut off his hair?

991
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,324
You told him it was "too gay"?

992
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:19,161
Dad, I made a mistake.
No big deal.

993
00:58:19,194 --> 00:58:20,564
No big deal?
That boy...

994
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,100
That poor boy!
Who are you?

995
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:23,403
Look, it was a dare, okay?

996
00:58:23,437 --> 00:58:25,374
A dare from who?
The Populars?

997
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,411
They said I could
be one of them.

998
00:58:27,444 --> 00:58:29,315
Okay. Honey,
I understand, but...

999
00:58:29,348 --> 00:58:30,651
What? You...
You "understand"?

1000
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:31,954
Yes, I understand

1001
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:34,025
that her home life right now
is very complicated...

1002
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:36,495
It doesn't matter
how complicated it is!

1003
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,266
God, Elliot, it's not about us.

1004
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,402
Of course it is!

1005
00:58:39,435 --> 00:58:40,881
"Us" is what has
allowed this to happen.

1006
00:58:40,905 --> 00:58:42,274
You mean me?

1007
00:58:42,308 --> 00:58:43,452
Well, I'm not the pregnant one.

1008
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,247
Okay, and I'm not
the one that said

1009
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,449
you'd be fine with anything,

1010
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,497
and then I tell you the truth,
and then you're not fine.

1011
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:49,623
Seriously, Gabby,

1012
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,035
you're not able to see
the ripple effect

1013
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:52,028
of what you've done.

1014
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,599
Your actions have had
a ripple effect as well,

1015
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:56,035
and you know it.

1016
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:57,271
Look...

1017
00:58:57,304 --> 00:59:00,110
we have to try to make this work
for the girls.

1018
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:01,647
The girls are the only reason

1019
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,015
I'm even still trying.

1020
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,906
Apologies
are so, so, so, so, so hard.

1021
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:24,893
You say you're sorry
to Dad all the time, but...

1022
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,766
it doesn't...

1023
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:29,937
it doesn't change anything.

1024
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,775
He's never gonna
change his mind.

1025
00:59:35,414 --> 00:59:37,184
Well...

1026
00:59:37,217 --> 00:59:39,989
that might be true.

1027
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:42,895
And that would suck, but...

1028
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:45,768
it doesn't mean
I stop apologizing.

1029
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:50,444
You know, I did something wrong.

1030
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:53,851
I have to apologize for it.

Hi, guys.

1047
01:01:32,782 --> 01:01:34,586
Uh, look.

1048
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:38,561
I don't want Christmas for you
to be like Thanksgiving for me,

1049
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:39,862
because it really sucked,

1050
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:40,965
so I thinking

1051
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:43,102
maybe Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day,

1052
01:01:43,136 --> 01:01:44,515
you could come over
and we could all

1053
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:46,276
celebrate together.

1054
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:49,114
Uh, just... think about it.
You know?

1055
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:50,551
I think it'd be
great for the girls.

1056
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:51,786
Okay.

1057
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:54,793
"Okay" you're gonna
think about it,

1058
01:01:54,826 --> 01:01:56,395
or "okay" you're gonna come?

1059
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:57,732
Okay, I'll come.

1060
01:01:57,766 --> 01:01:58,767
O-Okay, you're in?

1061
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:00,470
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay.

1062
01:02:00,503 --> 01:02:02,041
- Okay.
- Go back inside...

1063
01:02:02,074 --> 01:02:03,677
- before your feet freeze.
- Yeah.

1064
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:05,514
Okay. You're in.

1065
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,277
Crap. Crap.
Crap, crap.

1066
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,546
Gabby!

1067
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,682
- Hi!
- Hey!

1068
01:02:22,715 --> 01:02:26,456
Hi. I-I-I didn't
see you or hear you, or...

1069
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:27,558
anything.

1070
01:02:27,592 --> 01:02:28,727
Uh, I gotta go.

1071
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,729
Okay.

1072
01:02:29,762 --> 01:02:31,098
Okay, yeah.
It's good to see you.

1073
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:32,133
Okay.

1074
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:41,853
Matt...

1075
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:44,726
Oh...

1076
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,930
Gabby, that's...

1077
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,768
that's great.

1078
01:02:48,801 --> 01:02:51,607
Yeah, I should have told you.

1079
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,009
Uh...

1080
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:55,781
Why should you have told me?

1081
01:02:57,083 --> 01:03:00,290
Well, Elliot, my husband,

1082
01:03:00,323 --> 01:03:01,694
had a vasectomy,

1083
01:03:01,727 --> 01:03:04,431
so...

1084
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,107
The baby isn't his.

1085
01:03:10,778 --> 01:03:13,416
The baby's yours.

1086
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:21,934
Um...

1087
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:23,002
were you gonna tell me?

1088
01:03:23,035 --> 01:03:25,340
I mean, I tried to tell you.

1089
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:26,408
I did try to tell you,

1090
01:03:26,442 --> 01:03:27,788
but you said that
you didn't want to be a father.

1091
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:28,914
Remember?

1092
01:03:28,947 --> 01:03:31,687
And I don't know,
my life kind of exploded,

1093
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,792
and I was functioning
under this delusion

1094
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:37,766
that withholding
information from you

1095
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:40,537
was fair...
and it wasn't.

1096
01:03:42,107 --> 01:03:44,177
So...

1097
01:03:45,246 --> 01:03:46,248
Um...

1098
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,353
I understand if you don't want

1099
01:03:48,386 --> 01:03:50,758
anything to do with him.

1100
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:53,129
"With him"?

1101
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,603
It's okay.

1102
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:58,339
It's okay?

1103
01:03:58,373 --> 01:04:00,443
You should have told me, Gabby.

1104
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:02,113
This is not okay.

1105
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:22,220
This one's got to be
from Aunt Diane,

1106
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:24,124
and hopefully, it's a new iPad,

1107
01:04:24,157 --> 01:04:27,164
but I am sure it's not.

1108
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,032
Yep...

1109
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:30,270
Handmade wool hat!

1110
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:34,444
Oh, itchy head.
Itchy head!

1111
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:40,290
Ahem.

1112
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:41,760
Um...

1113
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,831
we'll be upstairs.

1114
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:45,901
Um, thank you, guys, so much,

1115
01:04:45,935 --> 01:04:47,706
I will be playing this
all night,

1116
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:48,707
and Merry Christmas.

1117
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:50,912
Merry Christmas.

1118
01:04:50,945 --> 01:04:53,249
We love you.

1119
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:08,413
I, uh...

1120
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,450
I'd better get going.

1121
01:05:10,483 --> 01:05:11,986
Uh, Elliot, Elliot.

1122
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,659
Wait one second.

1123
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:18,299
One more present.

1124
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:20,479
Oh, I didn't... I didn't
get you anything.

1125
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:21,506
It's okay.

1126
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,413
It's okay. Here.
It's for you.

1127
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,498
I can't accept this.

1128
01:05:40,678 --> 01:05:42,280
I'm seeing someone.

1129
01:05:43,116 --> 01:05:44,886
And I-I didn't plan

1130
01:05:44,919 --> 01:05:46,623
on telling you this
tonight, so, uh...

1131
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:48,627
Uh, no. No.

1132
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,564
Okay. Uh...

1133
01:05:50,597 --> 01:05:54,071
I can't expect you not
to see anyone, right?

1134
01:05:54,104 --> 01:05:56,042
I mean, look at you, you're...

1135
01:05:56,075 --> 01:05:57,343
It's Trish.

1136
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:01,853
It's Trish?

1137
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:04,424
Oh...

1138
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:05,595
You know, she's...

1139
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,164
No. Listen.

1140
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:09,335
Trish... Trish has
my seal of approval.

1141
01:06:09,368 --> 01:06:11,873
Not that you asked for
my seal of approval, but...

1142
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,816
You couldn't be dating anyone
with, like...

1143
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:20,624
you know, less flaws than Trish.

1144
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:23,262
Yeah. Uh...

1145
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:24,632
Well...

1146
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:25,467
Well, I am... I'm...

1147
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,972
Really glad we did this
for the girls.

1148
01:06:28,005 --> 01:06:29,408
You know?

1149
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:31,445
I'll see you in the morning.

1150
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:33,082
Okay.

1151
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:03,109
I'm sorry, baby.

1152
01:07:03,142 --> 01:07:05,948
I know this isn't the happiest
way to bring you here,

1153
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:07,885
but I promise...

1154
01:07:07,919 --> 01:07:09,823
once you get here,

1155
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:13,429
Mama's gonna figure out
a way to make it all better.

1156
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,151
What did you get
Mom for Christmas?

1157
01:07:24,184 --> 01:07:25,955
You didn't get her anything?

1158
01:07:25,988 --> 01:07:26,990
Okay, okay...

1159
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:29,128
You guys didn't wake me up.

1160
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:30,239
Oh, we figured
you needed a rest.

1161
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:31,231
What about Santa?

1162
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:32,544
Mom, you know
we know about Santa.

1163
01:07:32,568 --> 01:07:34,404
And we're doing
presents after breakfast

1164
01:07:34,437 --> 01:07:36,108
this year... family decision.

1165
01:07:36,142 --> 01:07:38,145
It's time to flip.
Out of my way. Oh!

1166
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,180
Honey, I can...

1167
01:07:39,214 --> 01:07:40,449
We've got it under control.

1168
01:07:48,868 --> 01:07:50,169
Oh.

1169
01:07:50,202 --> 01:07:51,840
Okay. Uh...

1170
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:53,008
Where are you going?

1171
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:54,178
We're eating.

1172
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:55,523
I gotta go upstairs
just for one...

1173
01:07:55,547 --> 01:07:57,026
We're not gonna start
without you, we waited for you.

1174
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,419
Yeah, Mom, I'm starving.

1175
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:02,595
Oh!

1176
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:03,864
Okay...

1177
01:08:03,897 --> 01:08:05,133
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1178
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:06,411
- You can go, you can go...
- No, no, no, no.

1179
01:08:06,435 --> 01:08:07,581
- And I will take a cab.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1180
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:09,709
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Breathe, breathe, breathe!

1181
01:08:09,742 --> 01:08:12,113
You gotta breathe,
breathe, breathe...

1182
01:08:12,147 --> 01:08:13,449
If this is anything like Alanna,

1183
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:14,528
we got to get you
to the hospital now.

1184
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:16,623
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1185
01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:18,593
My hospital bag is upstairs.

1186
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,296
You guys go get my hospital bag.

1187
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,434
Oh! God!
It's coming too fast. Okay.

1188
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:24,237
Gabby, you need to let go of me,

1189
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,516
and grab onto
the bed for a moment.

1190
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,710
Elliot.

1191
01:08:26,743 --> 01:08:28,245
Please?

1192
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:30,316
Alright.

1193
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:32,755
- Okay.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1194
01:08:32,788 --> 01:08:33,867
I'm so grateful you're here.

1195
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:35,761
Thank you.
Thank you.

1196
01:08:35,794 --> 01:08:37,364
Oh, Gabby, one more push!

1197
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:42,273
One more push!

1198
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:47,184
One more!

1199
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:51,592
Push.

1200
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:53,630
There you go.

1201
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:54,799
Almost.

1202
01:08:59,542 --> 01:09:01,579
Here he is, guys.
Good work!

1203
01:09:01,613 --> 01:09:03,282
Oh!

1204
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:06,522
Hi.

1205
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:09,428
Hi!

1206
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:12,400
Henry William Cartwright.

1207
01:09:14,204 --> 01:09:15,641
Cartwright?

1208
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:19,214
W-Wouldn't he have
another last name?

1209
01:09:19,247 --> 01:09:20,951
No.

1210
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:23,957
It's the same as my last name.

1211
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:28,566
I have to go, Gabby.

1212
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,304
I have to go.

1213
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,183
Hi.

1214
01:09:39,823 --> 01:09:41,091
Hi.

1215
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:43,229
I waited so long for you.

1216
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,932
You have no idea.

1217
01:09:46,168 --> 01:09:48,973
I did, and now here you are.

1218
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:53,415
I'm gonna love you so much.

1219
01:09:53,449 --> 01:09:56,589
Yeah. And you have
two sisters

1220
01:09:56,623 --> 01:09:59,427
and they're gonna
love you so much.

1221
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,940
And we're gonna be okay.

1222
01:10:04,973 --> 01:10:06,943
We're gonna be okay.

1223
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:09,334
Next year,

1224
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:11,906
we'll get you into
the other middle school here.

1225
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,842
A clean slate.

1226
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,780
I know that apologizing
wasn't easy and...

1227
01:11:16,816 --> 01:11:20,724
I know that being expelled
was really hard.

1228
01:11:20,758 --> 01:11:25,332
And I'm really proud of you
making the best of this, Alanna.

1229
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:28,573
How can you be so nice to me

1230
01:11:28,606 --> 01:11:31,746
about all these crappy things
I've done

1231
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:33,950
and you can't be nice to Mom?

1232
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,632
It's not that simple, kiddo.

1233
01:11:51,919 --> 01:11:53,256
How about a burp?

1234
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:54,758
Want to burp for me?

1235
01:11:55,594 --> 01:11:57,798
Okay. I know.
I know, I know, I know.

1236
01:11:58,733 --> 01:12:02,608
Okay, that's third sweater
today, little guy.

1237
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:04,946
Girls! Are you guys ready?

1238
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:07,316
Because if your dad gets here,
and you're not ready...

1239
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,921
You know he...

1240
01:12:08,954 --> 01:12:10,022
He's here!

1241
01:12:10,056 --> 01:12:12,227
Hurry up, okay?

1242
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,830
Come on, he's here!

1243
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,836
Hi.

1244
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:18,874
Oh...

1245
01:12:18,907 --> 01:12:20,476
Hi.

1246
01:12:28,258 --> 01:12:31,365
I just, uh...

1247
01:12:31,398 --> 01:12:34,171
I just needed to...

1248
01:12:34,204 --> 01:12:36,008
Yeah.

1249
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,745
That's cool.

1250
01:12:37,778 --> 01:12:39,815
Uh, Henry?

1251
01:12:39,849 --> 01:12:41,819
This is Matt.

1252
01:12:42,922 --> 01:12:45,927
Matt, this is... Henry.

1253
01:12:47,832 --> 01:12:49,702
Holy crap.

1254
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:51,706
Yeah.

1255
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:52,608
I made that?

1256
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:55,981
Well, I did
most of the heavy lifting,

1257
01:12:56,014 --> 01:12:57,652
but if, you know...

1258
01:12:57,685 --> 01:12:58,687
Mom!

1259
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,524
Can you tell Alanna that...

1260
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,696
Girls...

1261
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,570
This is Matt.

1262
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:09,808
This is Henry's dad.

1263
01:13:13,482 --> 01:13:14,552
Hold this.

1264
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:16,656
Sorry, she's not
normally so rude.

1265
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,860
Actually, that's debatable.

1266
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,898
Olivia!

1267
01:13:21,766 --> 01:13:24,037
Whoa, whoa,
just wait a second, though.

1268
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,742
Uh... Gabby?

1269
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,113
Hey.

1270
01:13:39,267 --> 01:13:40,267
Olivia.

1271
01:13:40,871 --> 01:13:43,475
Matt has a right to meet Henry.

1272
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:46,314
I mean, I don't know
if he wants to be involved...

1273
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:47,884
Involved? Involved?

1274
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:49,922
No, no.

1275
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,531
Look at me.

1276
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:57,237
There's nothing
between Me and Matt,

1277
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:59,440
except for Henry.

1278
01:13:59,474 --> 01:14:01,846
You know, if it wasn't for him,

1279
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,585
we would still be a real family.

1280
01:14:04,618 --> 01:14:07,057
Sweetheart,
we are a real family.

1281
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,696
I mean, maybe not the way

1282
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:11,332
we all thought it would be,

1283
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:12,634
but we are.

1284
01:14:13,936 --> 01:14:15,607
And I need you
to listen to me, okay?

1285
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,944
Because this is
really important.

1286
01:14:17,978 --> 01:14:20,583
You were right.

1287
01:14:21,451 --> 01:14:23,656
You're right,
this was my mistake.

1288
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,533
But this is where we are now,

1289
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:31,939
so we have to figure out
a way to move through it.

1290
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,620
I just...

1291
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:40,524
I just want things
to go back to how they were,

1292
01:14:40,557 --> 01:14:42,160
you know?

1293
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:46,535
I'm doing the best I can.
I really am, but it's a lot.

1294
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:50,610
And I need you to try
to accept Matt in the family.

1295
01:14:50,644 --> 01:14:53,014
For Henry's sake.

1296
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:02,467
Gabby?

1297
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,270
Try for me.

1298
01:15:04,304 --> 01:15:06,274
Gabby!

1299
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,997
Hi, Dad!

1300
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:34,799
Hey.

1301
01:15:34,832 --> 01:15:36,268
Olivia's running on Olivia time,

1302
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:37,436
which means I get shotgun.

1303
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,439
I forgot my phone.

1304
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:39,675
Hey.
Who's that, uh...

1305
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:42,447
Who's that walking
with your mom?

1306
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,585
That's Henry's dad.

1307
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:48,826
I gotta... Yeah. 'Kay.

1308
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,071
So Monroe is the girlfriend...

1309
01:16:11,104 --> 01:16:13,142
A model girlfriend.

1310
01:16:13,175 --> 01:16:14,377
A model girlfriend

1311
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,680
with a degree in Engineering

1312
01:16:15,713 --> 01:16:16,983
from Cal Tech.

1313
01:16:17,016 --> 01:16:18,820
Oh! Fancy.

1314
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,892
I think you'd like her.

1315
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,504
He stopped crying.

1316
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:28,673
See?

1317
01:16:28,707 --> 01:16:29,809
I told you!
You just keep

1318
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:32,548
trying every trick
until something works,

1319
01:16:32,581 --> 01:16:33,850
or you wear each other out,

1320
01:16:33,883 --> 01:16:35,052
whichever comes first.

1321
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:36,221
I have a lot learn.

1322
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:44,070
Yes. Yes,
I remembered the tiramisu.

1323
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:45,674
I did not forget.

1324
01:16:45,707 --> 01:16:46,709
Okay, sweetie. Bye.

1325
01:16:46,743 --> 01:16:47,678
I'll show you to a table.

1326
01:16:47,712 --> 01:16:49,347
Please follow me.

1327
01:16:52,486 --> 01:16:54,925
Gabby?

1328
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:56,327
Hi.

1329
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,265
Hi, guys!

1330
01:16:58,298 --> 01:17:00,002
You look great.

1331
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:03,342
And this little guy,
how adorable is he?

1332
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:06,081
Well, I think so.
Thank you.

1333
01:17:06,114 --> 01:17:07,317
Hi.

1334
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:09,487
Uh, so are you guys here to eat?

1335
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:11,960
That's a really silly question.

1336
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:14,866
Of course, you're having
dinner here!

1337
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:16,011
Yeah, we're, uh,
we're meeting friends.

1338
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:18,372
- Fun.
- They're at the table already.

1339
01:17:18,406 --> 01:17:19,373
I hate being late.

1340
01:17:19,407 --> 01:17:21,679
Excuse me. Hi.

1341
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,292
Hi.

1342
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:29,595
Hi.

1343
01:17:29,629 --> 01:17:30,840
Well, you think
you're done dating

1344
01:17:30,864 --> 01:17:34,437
and then you are couples-dating.

1345
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:38,846
Uh, look.

1346
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,253
Elliot, I want you to be happy,

1347
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,792
because I think
you deserve happiness

1348
01:17:44,825 --> 01:17:46,394
and-and I screwed up.

1349
01:17:46,427 --> 01:17:47,598
I did.

1350
01:17:47,631 --> 01:17:50,537
And it wasn't because of you
or anything in the marriage,

1351
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,106
and...

1352
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,911
there are days now
that I wake up

1353
01:17:54,945 --> 01:17:58,819
and I actually
don't hate myself.

1354
01:18:01,892 --> 01:18:04,665
But I have to tell you that...

1355
01:18:04,698 --> 01:18:06,735
Henry is...

1356
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:08,271
not a mistake.

1357
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:12,748
He's wonderful.

1358
01:18:12,781 --> 01:18:17,089
He's sweet and a gift...

1359
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,066
And he makes my heart so full.

1360
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:25,907
So I can't apologize anymore.

1361
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,811
I get it, Gabs.

1362
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:29,982
You do?

1363
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:31,150
I do.

1364
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:32,921
Elliot?

1365
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:34,891
Elliot,
their sitter has a hard out

1366
01:18:34,925 --> 01:18:36,896
and they've been waiting,
so we really should...

1367
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:38,132
Yeah.
Of course. I'm coming.

1368
01:18:38,165 --> 01:18:40,303
I'm sorry, Gabby.
You understand.

1369
01:18:40,336 --> 01:18:41,504
Of course!

1370
01:18:41,538 --> 01:18:43,041
Or would you like to join us?

1371
01:18:43,075 --> 01:18:45,547
Oh... no, that's sweet.
She's so sweet.

1372
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,916
No, no. That's fine.

1373
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:50,389
I've got the kids at home
and-and take-out

1374
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:51,457
and leaky boobs.

1375
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:53,028
I'm a disaster.

1376
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,130
Okay.

1377
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:56,334
It was nice to see you, Gabby.

1378
01:19:01,813 --> 01:19:02,781
I guess I should...

1379
01:19:02,814 --> 01:19:05,152
Go. Go, go.

1380
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:19,180
Hi.

1381
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,392
Here you go.
Sorry for the wait.

1382
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,086
Oh, thank you.

1383
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:26,428
That was a lovely evening.

1384
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:27,564
Elliot, I was thinking.

1385
01:19:27,598 --> 01:19:28,767
I know you said

1386
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,737
you wanted to stay
with a friend in Vermont,

1387
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:31,739
but then I remembered

1388
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:34,410
this inn
that Leah told me about.

1389
01:19:34,444 --> 01:19:35,681
It's spa heaven,

1390
01:19:35,714 --> 01:19:38,051
and we could use the get away.

1391
01:19:38,085 --> 01:19:41,091
A couple of couples' massages
never hurt anyone.

1392
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:43,896
We'll bring
the kids some other time...

1393
01:19:53,816 --> 01:19:55,452
And someone just canceled.

1394
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:56,589
Elliot?

1395
01:19:56,622 --> 01:19:57,591
What?

1396
01:19:57,624 --> 01:19:59,895
I booked it.

1397
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:03,468
The hotel.

1398
01:20:04,571 --> 01:20:07,142
Elliot?

1399
01:20:15,358 --> 01:20:17,363
Let's go home.

1400
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:20,235
Gabby, hi.

1401
01:20:20,269 --> 01:20:23,008
Trish, I didn't expect
to see you here.

1402
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:24,945
Well, I missed the sunrise yoga

1403
01:20:24,978 --> 01:20:26,949
so Claire convinced me
to sneak into this one.

1404
01:20:28,419 --> 01:20:30,455
Claire.

1405
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:33,663
So is this it?

1406
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:35,767
This is how it's gonna be now?

1407
01:20:35,801 --> 01:20:38,304
Forever?

1408
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,275
Um, maybe not?

1409
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:41,979
I hope not.

1410
01:20:43,883 --> 01:20:45,620
Uh, Trish, would it be weird

1411
01:20:45,653 --> 01:20:48,458
to ask you to say hi
to Elliot for me?

1412
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:49,962
It's... it's weird.

1413
01:20:49,995 --> 01:20:52,534
I know, I know.
It's weird. Okay.

1414
01:20:52,568 --> 01:20:54,571
Bye.

1415
01:21:01,519 --> 01:21:02,588
Gabby?

1416
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:04,223
Yeah?

1417
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,295
I'm not going to say hi
to Elliot for you.

1418
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:08,532
I know, that's so weird.
I'm sorry I asked.

1419
01:21:08,566 --> 01:21:12,439
Considering that we're not
seeing each other anymore...

1420
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:18,084
So I think that you should
say hi to him yourself.

1421
01:21:18,118 --> 01:21:19,120
Now.

1422
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,424
Really?

1423
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:22,594
Really.

1424
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:23,963
And Gabby, don't blow it.

1425
01:21:23,996 --> 01:21:26,234
You were meant to be together.

1426
01:21:26,268 --> 01:21:28,338
You just really are
impossibly perfect.

1427
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:32,479
Thank you.

1428
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:37,289
Hi! Excuse me!

1429
01:21:37,323 --> 01:21:40,496
Bumpy! Bumpy-bumpy.
Bumpy.

1430
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:41,566
Bumpy.

1431
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:42,967
Thank you.

1432
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,976
Gabby?
Gabby, stop.

1433
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:48,445
I need to talk to Elliot.

1434
01:21:48,478 --> 01:21:49,413
No. Don't go up there.

1435
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,586
What? He revoked
my walk-by-the-receptionist

1436
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:52,621
privileges?

1437
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:53,756
What? No, no.
He just...

1438
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:55,694
I can't do this.
I gotta go.

1439
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:57,196
This was a big mistake.
Listen.

1440
01:21:57,229 --> 01:21:59,535
Trish told me that I should...

1441
01:21:59,568 --> 01:22:01,808
- But I need to tell him myself.
- Tell me? Tell me what?

1442
01:22:03,943 --> 01:22:06,114
Hi. I was, uh,
trying to tell you

1443
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:07,684
that he just
ran to the coffee truck

1444
01:22:07,717 --> 01:22:09,220
and he'd be right back.

1445
01:22:09,254 --> 01:22:10,790
Oh.

1446
01:22:10,823 --> 01:22:12,560
Is everything okay?

1447
01:22:17,638 --> 01:22:19,173
No.

1448
01:22:19,206 --> 01:22:21,043
Everything is not okay.

1449
01:22:21,946 --> 01:22:23,348
I should be able to wake up

1450
01:22:23,382 --> 01:22:25,753
next to you in the morning,

1451
01:22:25,787 --> 01:22:27,858
and-and roll over

1452
01:22:27,891 --> 01:22:29,828
and stare into your eyes

1453
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,499
and-and say hi to you
for myself.

1454
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:41,083
I'm sorry in a million ways,

1455
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:45,258
I regret

1456
01:22:45,292 --> 01:22:48,264
hurting the man that I love.

1457
01:22:51,104 --> 01:22:53,742
And I want that man back.

1458
01:22:53,776 --> 01:22:55,111
Elliot, I do.

1459
01:22:55,145 --> 01:22:57,216
I want you back.

1460
01:22:57,249 --> 01:23:00,189
And I totally get
that it's impossible

1461
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:05,967
because Henry and I are, like,
you know, a package deal now,

1462
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,003
and...

1463
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:08,539
it's more than
you bargained for.

1464
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:09,808
Gabby.

1465
01:23:09,841 --> 01:23:11,812
I know.
I'm gonna go.

1466
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:12,814
I'm gonna go.

1467
01:23:12,848 --> 01:23:14,016
No, no, no.
Just...

1468
01:23:14,049 --> 01:23:15,653
wait.

1469
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,997
Look, you're not the only reason

1470
01:23:21,031 --> 01:23:22,710
that we're not waking up
in each other's arms

1471
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:24,671
every morning.

1472
01:23:24,704 --> 01:23:25,974
You told me,

1473
01:23:26,007 --> 01:23:27,043
and I wouldn't listen

1474
01:23:27,076 --> 01:23:29,213
because I was too busy
blaming you.

1475
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:36,394
And I wasn't able
to see or-or admit

1476
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,900
to my hand in where we ended up,

1477
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:41,137
and I don't know...

1478
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,676
I don't know when I stopped
talking to you about us,

1479
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:47,416
or stopped working on things,
but I did.

1480
01:23:48,451 --> 01:23:50,022
And...

1481
01:23:50,055 --> 01:23:51,324
I am sorry

1482
01:23:51,357 --> 01:23:54,129
in a million ways, too.

1483
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:01,778
You know how much
I love a package deal.

1484
